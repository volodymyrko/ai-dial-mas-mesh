        # 1. All the agents that will used as tools will have two parameters in request:
        #   - `prompt` (the request to agent)
        #   - `propagate_history`, boolean whether we need to propagate the history of communication with called agent
        # 2. Use AsyncDial (api_version='2025-01-01-preview'), call the agent with steaming option.
        #    Here, actually, you can find one of the most powerful features of DIAL - Unified protocol. All the
        #    applications that provide `/chat/completions` endpoint and following Unified protocol - can `communicate`
        #    between each other though Unified protocol (that is OpenAI compatible), in other words, applications can
        #    `communicate` between each other like they communication with OpenAI models (Unified protocol is OpenAI compatible).
        #    The second powerful feature is that the application that makes the call provides with whole context and
        #    responsible to manage this context. So, like we calling the model and provide it with the whole history in
        #    the same way we are working with applications, the application that makes a call provide the conversation history.
        #    ⚠️ To provide proper message history you need to implement the `_prepare_messages` method!
        #    ⚠️ Don't forget to include as extra_headers `x-conversation-id`!
        # 3. Prepare:
        #   - `content` variable, here we will collect the streamed content
        #   - `custom_content: CustomContent` variable, here we will collect variable CustomContent from agent response
        #   - `stages_map: dict[int, Stage]` variable, here will be persisted propagated stages
        # 4. Iterate through chunks and:
        #   - Stream content to the Stage (from tool_call_params) for this tool call
        #   - For custom_content:
        #       - set `state` from response CustomContent to the `custom_content`
        #       - in attachments are found propagate them to choice
        #       - Optional:
        #           Stages propagation: convert response CustomContent to dict and if stages are present:
        #           - each Stage has it is `index`, it will be returned in each chunk. If stage by such index is present
        #             in `stages_map` then you need to propagate content, otherwise you need to create stage
        #           - propagate stage name from response to propagated stage name, the same story for `content` and `attachments`
        #           - if response stage has `status = completed` - we need to close such stage
        # 5. Ensure that stages are closed (just iterate through them and close safely with StageProcessor)
